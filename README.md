## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd people-cars-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run install-deps
   ```

## Running the Application

### Development Mode
```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start both the server and client concurrently:
- Server: http://localhost:4000
- Client: http://localhost:3000
- GraphQL Playground: http://localhost:4000/graphql

### Production Mode
```bash
npm start
```

## API Endpoints

### GraphQL Queries
- `people`: Get all people with their cars
- `person(id)`: Get a specific person
- `cars`: Get all cars
- `car(id)`: Get a specific car
- `personWithCars(id)`: Get a person with all their cars

### GraphQL Mutations
- `addPerson(firstName, lastName)`: Add a new person
- `updatePerson(id, firstName, lastName)`: Update a person
- `deletePerson(id)`: Delete a person (also deletes their cars)
- `addCar(year, make, model, price, personId)`: Add a new car
- `updateCar(id, year, make, model, price, personId)`: Update a car
- `deleteCar(id)`: Delete a car

## Features in Detail
